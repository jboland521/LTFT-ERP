* LTFT.ERP_tutorial.R : A step-by-step implementation of the LTFT-ERP algorithm and the associated procedures described in "A Study of Longitudinal Trends in Time-Frequency                               Transformations of EEG Data during a Learning Experiment" by Boland et al. (2021).

* LTFT.ERP_MTFT.ERP_reshape.R: Function for performing Step 1 and Step 2 of the LTFT-ERP algorithm outlined in Section 2 of "A Study of Longitudinal Trends in Time-Frequency                                      Transformations of EEG Data during a Learning Experiment" by Boland et al. (2021). Specifically, this function filters the ERP waveforms for the                                    specified frequency band, performs the wavelet transformations to obtain the TFT power surfaces, and reshapes the subsequent TFT-surfaces into                                      vectors.
